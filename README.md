# AI Chrome Extension

## AI Chrome Extension
For this project, you are tasked with building an AI Chrome Extension that enables text autocomplete on any website.

For this project, you will be building a Chrome Extension that enables autocomplete for text fields on any website. Imagine you are writing a blog, filling out a form, or writing anything on a website, and you have an AI copilot to suggest completions for all the text you write, similar to what Cursor does with code.

**Getting Started:**

- Check out the Chrome Extension docs [here]( https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started)

**Project Requirements:**

- ​Display inline text completions while the user is typing
​- Complete the text when the user hits tab
- Handle edge cases like scrolling, text selection, and cursor position
- ​Work across sites without breaking their existing functionality

**Challenges:**

- Ensure minimal latency in the AI responses
- Handle focus, selection, and undo/redo functionality
- Perfectly match the textarea's font, size, and position
